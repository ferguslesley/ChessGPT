## Chess GPT

### What is the app?

Chess GPT is a simple chess game. The player aims to beat their opponent by delivering a checkmate. Their opponent is ChatGPT, a large language model. Language models have no ability to reason, and have no idea what a legal chess move is. Therefore, they're a perfect opponent for players who want to experience a more light-hearted, silly game of chess.

The graphics for the board and pieces will be simple 2d vector assets. There will be a statistics page where a player can see the quickest win or loss, a count of how many illegal moves the LLM makes, etc.

### Who is the app for?

Chess GPT is for people who are tired of playing chess seriously, and instead want to play a random, unpredictable version of the game. Chess is a very competitive community, so this app exists to provide entertainment without being mentally taxing. 

### Why am I making this app?

LLMs are fascinating, especially when they go wrong. Seeing ChatGPT make absurd chess moves made me realise it would provide entertainment value to a user to see a game of chess played out in real time against a LLM.
