## Chess GPT

### What is the app?

Chess GPT is a simple chess game. The player aims to beat their opponent by delivering a checkmate. Their opponent is ChatGPT, a large language model. Language models have no ability to reason, and have no idea what a legal chess move is. Therefore, they're a perfect opponent for players who want to experience a more light-hearted, silly game of chess.

The graphics for the board and pieces will be simple 2d vector assets. There will be a statistics page where a player can see the quickest win or loss, a count of how many illegal moves the LLM makes, etc.

### Who is the app for?

Chess GPT is for people who are tired of playing chess seriously, and instead want to play a random, unpredictable version of the game. Chess is a very competitive community, there is clear demand for a casual mode of chess, shown by videos getting millions of views (Rozman, 2023)

### Why am I making this app?

LLMs are fascinating, especially when they go wrong. Seeing ChatGPT make absurd chess moves made me realise it would provide entertainment value to a user to see a game of chess played out in real time against a LLM.

Comments from Sandy:

I really like the twist on this classic of the genre!

- You're really clear on who the app is for and why you want to make it. Good job. If I have one quibble here, it's that you could be a little clearer on your motivation, which I think at the moment reiterates things you've already said. Do you think you'll learn something about LLMs here? Or your perspective on them? What's the outcome?

– I have a clear idea of what to expect from the app from your description, which includes specific functionality. Make sure that you are investing your time appropriately. There are certainly scholarship marks available, but you don't want to get sucked too much into tweaking the visual over, say, adding new concrete functionality that would show your knowledge of the Android API. You seem to have clocked this already ("simple" vector graphics), but just try and stay focused.

- More broadly –and this doesn't need to go into the overview– make sure that you are getting that API coverage. I don't want to see anything crowbarred in, but equality there are opportunities to show a variety of skills (e.g., data modelling and persistent storage... maybe notfications...) across the board (ho-ho). Make sure you are showing the breadth of your knowledge too.

- You don't have to make this clear here, but presumably you are planning to use the OpenAI APIs for this? I think these are paid, so make sure you are confident you'll be able to tap into the services you'll need before you embark on the project.

– I made it 199 words ;-)

Hope these ar useful, feel free to query them if anything is unclear.
